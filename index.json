However, my main research focus has been the application of thermal remote sensing in terrestrial ecosystems, first mainly ground-based but in the last few years predominantly UAV-based.\nWith a master in forest ecology, the focus of my Ph.D. at KULeuven, Belgium was on how thermal remote sensing can be applied for assessing forest functioning and detecting drought stress in terrestrial ecosystems. One of the experimental plants we used in this research was a tropical biofuel crop, Jatropha curcas, which at the time was hyped as a new miracle crop, based on scientifically unfunded claims. This triggered our interest in the crop, leading to several studies on the sustainability of this crop and of biofuels in general.\nAfter my PhD in 2010, I joint Ghent University and further focused my research on the application of thermal remote sensing in agricultural and natural ecosystems. For this research, we started applying a UAV (or drone), and I specialized in all aspects of UAVs (UAV programming, piloting, maintenance, processing of data, etc).\nJoining the Remote Sensing group of Alfredo Huete at UTS, Sydney in 2014 allowed me to broaden my experience of UAVs to multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing, including solar-induced fluorescence. This latter application is the focus of my current project, in which we will mainly use satellite data to estimate evapotranspiration.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4885279b2647597afa7cb0bbc6cdce6c","permalink":"/author/wouter-maes/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/wouter-maes/","section":"authors","summary":"I have a broad research interest, extending from sustainability of water use over forest ecology and biofuels.
